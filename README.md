# The-Third-Eye - A Home Monitoring System
Our project is an Arduino based smart home monitoring system. Its designed as a part of academic project but we are plannng big and take it further for more improvements. For the project purpose we mostly used components which are relatively cheap and readily available. It collects different sensor values and sends to a remote server.Any one can monitor sensor activities through a web page or a mobile app

## Key Features
 1. Measure room temprature.
 2. Measure room humidity.
 3. Can detect either light on/off in the room.
 4. Can detect motion in the room.
 5. Can sence fire in the room.
 6. With presence of fire, it can ring an Alarm.
 7. A switch to turn on/off the Fire Alarm.
 8. All status can be viewed from a web page from any where in the world.

## Components we need 

THe following components are used in our project

 1. One DHT 11 Sensor
 2. One Photoresistor
 3. One IR Flame Detector
 4. One Ultrasonic Range Finder
 5. One ESP8266 WiFi Shield
 6. One LCD Panel
 7. One Piezo Buzzer
 8. One Slider  Switch
 9. Bunch of Jumper Wires
 10. Bunch of Resistors
 11. One Web Server
 12. Mobile App and Web Page
